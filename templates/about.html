  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
  recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
  came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
  decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also
  believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
  superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
  business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.
